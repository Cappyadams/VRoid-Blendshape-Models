## What is this?
this is a github repository. jk jk, This is where you can find models for copying blendshapes to your VRoid models! You can use these models as refernce or you can copy blendshapes from these models over to your models. That's your choice!


## How do I copy Blendshapes from these models to mine?
There are probably many ways to copy blendshapes. however, I recommend using the [NEB Unity plugin](https://youtu.be/Q1_obTcE_uE?si=u3zEuuFVkXCMgt61).


## Where are the ARKit blendshape models in this project?
There's already a [ARkit VRoid Blendshape Project](https://github.com/hinzka/52blendshapes-for-VRoid-face) on github. however I _**might**_ make a male and female model for ARkit blendshapes.
